# Algorand School
Algorand School is an open slide deck I've built over time during my talks on 
Algorand's blockchain.

The goal of the deck is providing a step-by-step introduction to Algorand's 
technology, ecosystem and tools, in order to lower the learning curve difficulty 
and speed up the learning process. 

Main topics of the Algorand School are:

1. 🕸 Understanding Algorand Consensus and Algorand Networks
2. 🛠 Familiarizing with the Algorand Nodes and Dev Tools
3. 🤝 Shedding light on Algorand's Account and Transactions
4. 🤖 Clarifying how to develop dApps on the Algorand Virtual Machine

### Contents
1. Algorand Consensus
2. Algorand Decentralized Governance
3. Algorand Networks
4. Algorand Transactions
5. Algorand Accounts
6. Algorand Virtual Machine
7. Algorand Smart Contracts on Layer-1
8. Smart Signatures & Smart Contracts
9. TEAL
10. PyTEAL (credits to [@jasonpaulos](https://github.com/jasonpaulos) for the contents)
11. dApp Example & Use Cases

#### Note
Almost all the contents presented in the Algorand School derive directly from 
the [Algorand Developer Portal](https://developer.algorand.org/), which 
remains the first and most important source of information about Algorand.
