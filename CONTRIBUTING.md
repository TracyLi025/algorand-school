## Contibuting with translations
Would you like to contribut to the Algorand's educational cause? Help me with 
the translation!

Just follow the translations guidelines:
1. Fork the repo
2. Rename `algorand-school-english.txt` into `algorand-school-<language>.txt`
3. Add your translations for the text fields
4. Submit a PR

I will review the translation, merge it into presentation's source file and 
publish the PDF once the translation is finalized.

All the contributors will be included into the `Credits` slide.
